            <p> LinkedIn is a social networking site designed specifically for the business community. The goal of the site is to allow registered members to establish and document networks of people they know and trust professionally. The history behind LinkedIn started out in the living room of co-founder Reid Hoffman in 2002. The site officially launched on May 5, 2003. At the end of the first month in operation, LinkedIn had a total of 4,500 members in the network. Roughly one million new members join LinkedIn every week, at a rate equivalent to a professional joining the site faster than one member per second. The company is publicly held and has a diversified business model with revenues coming from user subscriptions, advertising sales and hiring solutions.</p>
